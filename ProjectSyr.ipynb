    "SyriaTel, a leading telecommunications company, has been experiencing customer churnâ€”customers stopping their service or switching to competitors. Customer churn is a critical issue as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. Thus, predicting which customers are likely to churn soon and implementing strategies to retain them can significantly impact the company's revenue and growth.\n",

    "## Business Problem\n",

    "The primary stakeholder for this project is the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of SyriaTel. The CMO is responsible for overseeing the company's marketing strategies and customer retention efforts. By identifying patterns of customer churn, the CMO can implement targeted marketing campaigns and retention strategies to minimize churn rates and enhance customer loyalty.\n",
